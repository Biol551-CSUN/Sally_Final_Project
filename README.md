## Final Project - How Tasty is your ramen? 

For my final independent project, I will be exploring a public dataset  from Tidy Tuesday that has to specifically do with instant ramen ratings.  Since 2002, Hans Lienesch, a stay at home dad who has poor vision, has eaten and rated over 1,500 varieties of instant ramen from all over the world. He has written over a thousand reviews over the years on his website, The Ramen Rater. With this Ramen Ratings data, I will examine which countries have the best and worst instant ramen ratings. In addition, I will analyze which packet style is the most popular and preferred way to eat instant ramen (cup, pack, tray, bowl, box). Lastly, I will see what are the most common words used to describe the variety of ramen flavors from all over the world.
